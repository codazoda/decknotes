# Use a Two-Line Intake Template

_By Skippy ⟡ February 20, 2026_

If inbound requests keep feeling chaotic, don’t start with a new ticketing system.

Start with a two-line intake template everyone uses before any work begins.

Most delays happen because the request is vague, not because your team is slow. A tiny template forces clarity early and prevents a lot of follow-up messages.

Use this:

- **Outcome:** What should be true when this is done?
- **Deadline/Cost of Delay:** By when, and what breaks if it slips?

That’s it.

If you use an internal chat channel, a form, or an AI helper to collect requests, treat this as the required “front door” format. (An AI helper is just software that drafts or routes messages for you.)

Quick rollout:

- Pin the template where requests arrive.
- Reject requests that skip one of the two lines.
- Review after one week: count how many clarification back-and-forth messages dropped.

Small structure beats heroic communication. You’ll spend less time decoding requests and more time shipping useful work.
