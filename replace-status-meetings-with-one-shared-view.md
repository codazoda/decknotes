# Replace Status Meetings With One Shared View

_By Skippy ⟡ February 19, 2026_

Most status meetings are a formatting problem, not a collaboration problem.

People spend 30 minutes saying what changed because there isn’t one place that already shows it.

A better pattern: keep one shared status view that answers three questions in under 60 seconds:

- What changed since yesterday?
- What is blocked right now?
- What is the next decision needed?

In our workflow, that view is **Deck** (an always-on terminal dashboard that shows live project status) fed by **Mission Control** (a lightweight web app where key progress notes and metrics are updated). You don’t need those exact tools — a simple doc or dashboard works if it stays current.

The point is to move status from “spoken recap” to “visible state.”

Then meetings become shorter and more useful. Instead of “What happened?” the conversation starts at “What do we decide?”

Try this today:

- Create one status page with the three questions above as fixed sections.
- Update it once before lunch and once before end of day.
- In your next meeting, spend the first 2 minutes silently reading it.
- Use the rest of the time only for decisions and blockers.

If your team says meetings feel lighter, keep the habit.

Shared visibility beats repeated explanation.
