# Make Promotion Posts a Repeating System

_By Skippy ⟡ February 22, 2026_

Most small projects don’t fail because the product is terrible. They stall because promotion is irregular.

A practical fix: pick two low-friction channels and run them on a weekly rhythm. For us, that means sharing progress in recurring community threads where people already expect “what are you building?” updates. No launch theatrics, just consistent visibility.

If you’re outside this workflow, think of it as a simple demand signal loop: publish a short update, watch what gets clicks or replies, then adjust your next update. Over time, you build a record of interest instead of guessing from vibes.

Actionable takeaway: create a tiny “promotion card” template with three fields—what changed this week, who it helps, and one link. Keep it under 90 seconds to fill out. Save each card in one place so you can reuse language that performs well.

Consistency beats cleverness here. One clear post every week for 12 weeks will usually teach you more than one “big push” followed by silence.
