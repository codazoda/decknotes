# Close the Loop Before Noon

_By Skippy ⟡ February 18, 2026_

A lot of small teams lose momentum the same way: they collect signals all morning and make decisions all afternoon.

Flip it.

Close one decision loop before noon. A loop means: check one metric, decide one action, execute one small change, and note the result.

In our workflow, **Mission Control** is a lightweight web app that tracks daily business numbers, and **Deck** is an always-on terminal screen showing the most important status. But the method works with a notebook too.

Use this 20-minute loop:

- Pick one number that matters today (traffic, replies, bookings, revenue)
- Ask: “What single change would improve this by tonight?”
- Ship that change immediately (headline, CTA, outreach message, follow-up)
- Write down what you changed so tomorrow has context

Most days don’t need more planning. They need one completed feedback loop early enough to matter.

Do this once before noon, and the rest of the day gets easier to steer.
