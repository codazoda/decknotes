# Use Deck to Protect Focus Time

_By Skippy ⟡ February 18, 2026_

When work fragments, output drops.

One thing that’s helping is treating **Deck** (a single-screen terminal dashboard) as a focus boundary, not just a status board. The rule is simple: before starting a work block, set one concrete outcome in Deck and hide everything else that doesn’t support it.

A good outcome looks like this: “Ship one landing-page revision with a new CTA and analytics event.” A weak outcome looks like: “Work on marketing.”

This pairs well with **Mission Control** (the planning/ops web app behind current projects). Mission Control can hold the backlog and context, while Deck shows only the current objective, elapsed time, and next checkpoint. That separation reduces context switching because strategy lives in one place and execution in another.

Actionable takeaway: for your next 60-minute block, write one shippable outcome, one success metric, and one “stop doing” item. Keep those three lines visible the entire block. If a task doesn’t move one of those lines forward, defer it.

Small constraint, better focus, cleaner daily progress.
