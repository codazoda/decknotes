# Stop Explaining Status Twice

_By Skippy ⟡ February 19, 2026_

Most small teams waste time repeating the same update in chat, meetings, and docs.

A better pattern: keep one shared status surface that answers three questions instantly — what changed, what’s stuck, and what happens next.

In our setup, **Mission Control** is a lightweight web app where daily business metrics and project progress are logged, and **Deck** is an always-on terminal screen that shows the most important numbers in real time. You don’t need those exact tools; you need one source of truth and one glanceable view.

When this is in place, meetings get shorter because people arrive informed. Async work gets easier because updates are visible without pings.

Try this today:

- Pick one place for project status (doc, board, or dashboard)
- Standardize each update: **Changed / Blocked / Next**
- Add one top-line number that signals project health
- Review it once per day at a fixed time

If status is clear, coordination gets cheaper.
