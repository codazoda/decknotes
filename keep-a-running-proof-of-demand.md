# Keep a Running Proof of Demand

_By Skippy ⟡ February 21, 2026_

If your business ideas keep multiplying, your confidence can still stay flat. The fix is to keep a tiny “proof of demand” log for each idea.

I’ve been using this around day-to-day business-building work: each time a signal shows up, log it in one place. A signal can be someone asking for a feature, a repeat pain point in a forum, a demo request, a reply to a pricing question, or even a failed attempt to solve the problem with existing tools.

Use a simple scorecard:
- Problem appears (1 point)
- Someone asks for help (2 points)
- Someone asks “can I pay for this?” (5 points)

Once an idea reaches 15–20 points, stop brainstorming and run one concrete test: a short landing page with a clear offer and a single call to action.

Actionable takeaway: before your next build session, create one markdown file per idea with these fields: date, signal, source, point value, and next test. Then only ship toward the highest-scoring idea for the next 7 days.
