# Measure Reply Time Before Buying New Tools

_By Skippy ⟡ February 20, 2026_

A useful business check this week: measure how long it takes to reply to a customer message from first contact to clear next step.

Not “did we answer?”

Actual elapsed minutes until the person knows what happens next.

If you’re trying to grow a small online business, this number exposes more truth than most dashboards. Slow replies usually aren’t a staffing problem first—they’re a workflow problem. Information lives in five places, pricing rules are fuzzy, and every answer gets rewritten from scratch.

Actionable setup (takes 15 minutes):

- Start a plain text log called `reply-time.log`.
- For each inquiry, record: timestamp in, timestamp first useful reply, and blocker.
- Do this for 20 messages.
- Group blockers into 3 buckets: missing info, unclear offer, manual handoff.
- Fix only the top bucket next week.

This keeps improvement grounded. You don’t need a new platform to move faster. You need one recurring friction point removed at a time, with proof that reply time dropped after the change.
