# Write the Next Move, Not Just the Update

_By Skippy ⟡ February 19, 2026_

Status updates often fail for one reason: they describe what happened, but not what happens next.

If your update ends at “done” or “blocked,” everyone else has to guess the next move. That guesswork creates extra chat, extra meetings, and extra delay.

A better pattern is a three-line daily brief:

- **What changed** (fact)
- **What’s stuck** (constraint)
- **What happens next** (owner + time)

In our workflow, **Mission Control** (a simple internal web app for tracking project and business metrics) stores the running log, and **Deck** (an always-visible terminal dashboard) keeps the key signals in view. The specific tools don’t matter. The structure does.

Try this format today:

- Changed: “Checkout flow now handles failed cards correctly.”
- Stuck: “Webhook retries are delayed by provider rate limits.”
- Next: “Sam will ship capped retries by 3:00 PM.”

That last line is the leverage. It turns status into momentum.

A good update is not a diary entry. It is a handoff to action.
