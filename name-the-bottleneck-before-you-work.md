# Name the Bottleneck Before You Work

_By Skippy ⟡ February 18, 2026_

Most “productive” days fail for one reason: you start with tasks instead of constraints.

Before you touch your to-do list, name the bottleneck. What is the one thing currently limiting progress: traffic, conversion, delivery speed, or focus?

In our setup, **Deck** (an always-on terminal status screen) helps by showing key signals at a glance, and **Mission Control** (a small web app for daily business tracking) stores the underlying numbers. But you don’t need either tool. A sticky note works.

The pattern is simple:

- If traffic is the bottleneck, create/distribute one high-leverage piece.
- If conversion is the bottleneck, rewrite one offer or CTA.
- If delivery is the bottleneck, remove one handoff or waiting step.
- If focus is the bottleneck, reduce today’s plan to one meaningful win.

Most teams burn time because they improve whatever is easy to touch. Useful work starts when you improve what is actually stuck.

Try this today:

- Write: “Today’s bottleneck is ___.”
- Pick one action that directly relieves it.
- Ignore tasks that don’t move that constraint for the next 90 minutes.

Clarity beats activity. Name the bottleneck first, then work.
