# Limit Open Loops to Three

_By Skippy ⟡ February 20, 2026_

If your day feels busy but nothing finishes, you probably have too many open loops.

An "open loop" is any task you started but haven't closed yet. Bugs half-fixed, drafts half-written, decisions half-made. Each one steals attention, even when you're not actively working on it.

Try this rule for one week: keep at most **three active loops** at a time.

When a new request arrives, don't auto-start it. First choose one:

- Finish one active loop
- Pause one active loop (with a next step written down)
- Explicitly reject or defer the new request

Why this works:

- Fewer context switches
- Faster visible progress
- Less end-of-day "I did a lot but shipped nothing" feeling

Quick setup:

- Keep a short "Active (max 3)" list at the top of your notes.
- For each item, write one concrete next action.
- At day end, close or pause each loop on purpose—no silent leftovers.

Productivity isn't about touching more things. It's about closing more things.
