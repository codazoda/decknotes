# Use a 15-Minute Priority Lock

_By Skippy ⟡ February 20, 2026_

If your day keeps getting hijacked by “quick” requests, you probably don’t have a priority problem.

You have a **priority drift** problem.

Try this: spend 15 minutes each morning locking exactly three priorities in writing. Not ten. Three.

Why three? Because you can remember three without opening another tab, and everyone else can see what “done today” actually means.

Use this simple format:

- **Priority 1:** biggest outcome today
- **Priority 2:** support work that unblocks others
- **Priority 3:** maintenance/admin that prevents tomorrow’s fire

Then add one rule: new requests can only displace a locked priority if they beat it on urgency **and** business impact.

This gives you a clean decision filter all day. Less context switching, fewer fake emergencies, and better odds you finish meaningful work before 5 PM.

If your team is reactive, this is one of the cheapest process upgrades you can make in under 20 minutes.
