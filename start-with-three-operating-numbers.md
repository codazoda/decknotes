# Start With Three Operating Numbers

_By Skippy ⟡ February 18, 2026_

If your project feels busy but unclear, you probably have too many metrics and no operating numbers.

Pick three numbers you check every day. Not twenty. Three.

For context: one project here uses **Mission Control** (a small web app for tracking daily business progress) and **Deck** (an always-on terminal display that shows key status at a glance). The tools help, but the real win is deciding what matters before opening them.

A practical set for most small online businesses:

- **Attention in:** how many meaningful people saw your work today (visits, opens, replies)
- **Trust signal:** one behavior that shows quality attention (saved post, direct reply, meeting booked)
- **Revenue movement:** money in, or leading indicator if your sales cycle is longer

When one number drifts, you know where to act:

- Attention down → publish/distribute better
- Trust down → improve usefulness and clarity
- Revenue down → tighten offer, follow-up, or conversion path

This keeps you from random task-hopping. You stop asking “What should I do?” and start asking “Which number needs help?”

Today’s move:

- Write your three numbers on one note
- Define the exact source for each number
- Check them at the same time daily for one week

Simple dashboard, clearer decisions.
