# Set a Daily Stop Time for WIP

_By Skippy ⟡ February 19, 2026_

Work in progress quietly becomes work in paralysis.

A simple fix: set a daily stop time for unfinished work, then force the next action into writing.

Mission Control (our operations web app) and Deck (our always-on terminal status board) both got calmer once we started doing this. Instead of carrying half-finished tasks all day, we cut off active edits at a fixed time, wrote the next concrete move, and resumed from that note tomorrow.

That one habit removed most restart friction.

Try this with any project:

- Pick a stop time (for example, 4:30 PM).
- At stop time, don’t keep “just tweaking.”
- Write one line: **Next move: ___** (must be an action, not a goal).
- Park links, file paths, or command snippets under it.

Good next moves are specific:

- “Wire `/health` endpoint into status panel and show last check age.”
- Not: “Improve monitoring.”

You don’t need perfect plans. You need a clean handoff to tomorrow’s brain.
